name	def
status	whether the core has been registered or not. Note that `R0-c1` will never be titled as `registered` since this is the reference image.
core	core identifier, this is the core cluster label assigned during segmentation and across-round matching.   
round	The image round identifier, should be in format `R<int>`. Note that R0 is autofluorescence only, except for R0,c1 which is DAPI used for registration reference frame. 
color_channel	fluorescence wavelength measured. c1 is always DAPI, c2-5 may reflect different protein antibodies depending on the round. The specific channel-protein mapping is encoded in the original scan name. 
path	*local path* or core file name. 
center_x/y	core segmentation center x/y coordinate, in reference to the original (potentially downsampled) scan image (full scan-scene).
width/height	core segmentation width/height (potentitally downsampled); see config.py for details.
